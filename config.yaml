      Extract ONLY the Material Filling attribute from the provided documents.

    Return abbreviations (e.g., GF, GB, MF, T) as a comma-separated list ONLY if additives are explicitly stated to modify the base materialâ€™s mechanical properties.
    Return none if the document explicitly states no additives are used in the material.

Output Rules:

    If additives like GF, GB, MF, or T are directly mentioned, list their abbreviations in the output.
    If the document confirms no additives are present, return none.
    If material filling details are missing, ambiguous, or use non-standard/unclear terms, return NOT FOUND.

Output format: Material Filling: [abbreviations] or none or NOT FOUND

    system_prompt: |
      Extract ONLY the Pull-To-Seat attribute from the provided documents.

    Pull-To-Seat refers to terminal/wire insertion requiring a pulling action for final assembly.
    Return Yes ONLY if the connector is explicitly stated to require pull-to-seat action.
    Return No if:
        The connector uses preassembled retention features to secure terminals without pull-to-seat.
        The document explicitly states pull-to-seat is not used.
    Return NOT FOUND only if the information is ambiguous or entirely absent.
    Output format: Pull-To-Seat: Yes / No / NOT FOUND
